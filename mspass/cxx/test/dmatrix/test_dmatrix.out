Test program for dmatrix class
Calling procedure to generate matrix A
This tests initializing constructor, operator(), copy constructor, and operator=
Success:  printing result to test operator <<
 2 4
 3 -2
 -1 6

Testing size methods
Number of columns in A=2
Number of rows in A=3
This should be the output of the size operator as a dvector
Number rows=3 Number of columns=2
Success:  testing tr procedure
Success:  result

Success:  testing multiplication operator
First compute AT*A
Result
