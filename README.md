# SCOPED Apps

This repository contains the applications for the SCOPED project which can be found on the [SeisSCOPED github](https://github.com/SeisSCOPED). The purpose of this repository is to maintain seperate versions of these apps to support their use on TACC's [tapis](https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) infrastructure and on the Apptainer runtime. 

For more information on each of the apps, checkout the README.md in each subdirectory.
